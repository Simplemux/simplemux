rohc_protocol \- The ROHC protocol

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBRObust Header Compression (ROHC) protocol\fP aims at \fBreducing
bandwidth\fP usage on network links with \fBlimited capacity\fP or
\fBexpensive costs\fP, such as mobile networks or satellite links. It defines
a \fBlossless compression scheme\fP for network headers. It does not act on
the network payload in any way.
.PP
The \fBROHC protocol\fP is very efficient for compressing \fBVoIP streams\fP
that use \fBRTP\fP as transport protocol. \fBROHC\fP is also suitable for
compressing \fBIPv4\fP, \fBIPv6\fP, \fBUDP\fP, \fBUDP-Lite\fP, \fBESP\fP, and
\fBTCP\fP headers of Internet packets.

.SH MAIN PRINCIPLES
.PP
The ROHC protocol compresses only network headers. It leaves the network
payload unchanged.

.RE
.PP
In order to compress the network headers, the ROHC protocol takes advantage of
the information redundancy in the different headers of:
.RS 2
.IP o 3
one single network packet (eg. the payload lengths in IP and UDP headers),
.IP o 3
several network packets that belongs to one single stream (eg. the IP
addresses).

           +-----------+  +-----------+
.RE
.PP
Redundant information is transmitted in first packets only. Next packets
contain variable information only, eg. identifiers or sequence numbers. Theses
fields are furthermore transmitted in a adequate compressed form to save some
more bits.
.PP
For better performances, the packets must be classified into streams before
being compressed. This is a requirement to take advantage of inter-packet
redundancy. The classification algorithm is not defined by the ROHC protocol
itself but left to the implementations.

.RE
.PP
Once a stream of packets was identified, it is compressed according to the
compression profile that fits best. A compression profile defines the way to
compress the different fields in the network headers. Several compression
profiles are available: Uncompressed, IP-only, IP/UDP, IP/UDP-Lite, IP/ESP,
IP/UDP/RTP, IP/UDP-Lite/RTP and IP/TCP.

.SH STANDARDIZATION
.PP
The ROHC protocol is mainly standardized by the IETF, but some protocol
numbers are defined by other organisms.
.PP
.IP IETF - Internet Engineering Task Force
The ROHC protocol is standardized by the \fBIETF\fP. The ROHC Working Group
was formed to specify a \fBcommon compression protocol platform\fP. Several
Requests For Comments (RFC) were published to define the ROHC framework and a
number of compression profiles. The RFCs are listed on the \fBSEE ALSO\fP
section of this document.
.IP IANA - Internet Assigned Numbers Authority
The IANA is in charge of ROHC protocol identifiers assignments for ROHC
profiles, but also the Internet protocol number 142 to the ROHC protocol.
.IP IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
The IEEE maintains the registry of Ethernet/802.3 protocol identification. The
ROHC protocol is registered with value 0x22F1.

.SH FRAMEWORK
.PP
The ROHC protocol defines an extensible ROHC framework capable of compressing
different kinds of streams (IP, UDP, TCP, RTP...). The framework is generic.
The profiles then define how the different kinds of streams are compressed.
A profile is a set of encoding schemes and packet formats.
.SS Definitions
.PP
A \fBROHC compressor\fP parses uncompressed packets, associate them to a
stream, builds the corresponding ROHC packets and transmits them to its
associated ROHC decompressor at the other end of the network link.
.PP
A \fBROHC decompressor\fP parses ROHC packets transmitted by its associated
ROHC compressor, decodes the packet fields according to the ROHC algorithms
and then builds the corresponding uncompressed packets.
.PP
One compressor is associated with only one decompressor. One decompressor is
associated with only one compressor.
.PP
.RS 1
 uncompressed                 ROHC                     uncompressed
    packets   +------------+ packets  +--------------+ packets
 -----------> | Compressor | -------> | Decompressor | ----------->
              +------------+          +--------------+
.RE
.PP
Both the compressor and the decompressor store some information bits for every
network stream they handle. This information is called a \fBstream context\fP.
The compressor and the decompressor do not store the same data in their
context. The compressor uses uses its contexts to associate a received packet
to a stream and to detect the fields that change over time. The decompressor
uses its contexts to retrieve the fields that are not transmitted in all the
packets.

.SS Modes of operation
.PP
The ROHC protocol proposes 3 modes of operations:
.RS 2
.IP o 3
the Unidirectional mode (U-mode),
.IP o 3
the Bidirectional Optimistic mode (O-mode),
.IP o 3
the Bidirectional Reliable mode (R-mode).
.RE
.PP
In U-mode, packets are transmitted in one direction only: from the compressor
to the decompressor. This is useful for network links with no or undesirable
return path. In order to handle potential decompression errors, the compressor
sends periodic refreshes of the stream context to the decompressor.
.PP
.RS 1
 +------------+                   +--------------+
 |            |   ROHC packets    |              |
 | Compressor | ----------------> | Decompressor |
 |            |                   |              |
 +------------+                   +--------------+
.RE
.PP
The O-mode works the same way as the U-mode. However feedback packets are
transmitted by the decompressor on the return path for reporting errors or
acknowledging successful decompression to the compressor.
.PP
.RS 1
 +------------+   ROHC packets    +--------------+
 |            | ----------------> |              |
 | Compressor |                   | Decompressor |
 |            | <---------------- |              |
 +------------+   ROHC feedback   +--------------+
.RE
.PP
The R-mode makes use feedback information too. However it is stricter than the
O-mode for context updates.
.PP
.RS 1
 +------------+   ROHC packets    +--------------+
 |            | ----------------> |              |
 | Compressor |                   | Decompressor |
 |            | <---------------- |              |
 +------------+   ROHC feedback   +--------------+
.RE
.PP
Both the compressor and the decompressor starts in U-mode. They may then
operate a transition to O-mode if a usable return link is available and the
decompressor sends to the compressor a positive acknowledgement with O-mode
specified. The transition to R-mode is achieved the same way.

.SS Compressor/decompressor states
.PP
The notion of compressor/decompressor states is orthogonal to the operational
modes. Whatever the mode is, both the compressor and the decompressor work in
one of their three states. They are basically finite state machines. Every
incoming packet may cause the compressor/decompressor to change its internal
state. Every state refers to a defined behaviour and compression level.
.PP
The compressor's state machine defines the following three states:
.RS 2
.IP o 3
Initialization and Refresh (IR) State,
.IP o 3
First Order (FO) State,
.IP o 3
Second Order (SO) State.
.RE
.PP
.RS 1
 +----------+         +----------+         +----------+
 | IR State | <-----> | FO State | <-----> | SO State |
 +----------+         +----------+         +----------+
.RE
.PP
Transitions between the above states occur when the compressor:
.RS 2
.IP o 3
compresses a packet that contains too many variations,
.IP o 3
receives a positive/negative feedback from the decompressor,
.IP o 3
periodically refreshes the context.
.RE
.PP
The decompressor's state machine defines the following three states:
.RS 2
.IP o 3
No Context State,
.IP o 3
Static Context State,
.IP o 3
Full Context State.
.RE
.PP
.RS 1
 +--------------+       +----------------+       +--------------+
 |  No Context  | <---> | Static Context | <---> | Full Context |
 +--------------+       +----------------+       +--------------+
.RE
.PP
Transitions between the above states occur when the decompressor:
.RS 2
.IP o 3
successfully decompresses a packet,
.IP o 3
fails to decompress several packets.
.RE

.SS Packet types
.PP
The Uncompressed profile defines the following ROHC packets:
.RS 2
.IP o 3
IR,
.IP o 3
Normal.
.RE
.PP
The IP/UDP/RTP profile defines the following ROHC packets:
.RS 2
.IP o 3
IR,
.IP o 3
IR-DYN,
.IP o 3
Type 0: UO-0, R-0, R-0-CRC,
.IP o 3
Type 1: UO-1, UO-1-ID, UO-1-TS, R-1, R-1-ID, R-1-TS,
.IP o 3
Type 2: UOR-2.
.RE
.PP
The IP-only, non-RTP IP/UDP and IP/ESP profiles define the following ROHC
packets:
.RS 2
.IP o 3
IR,
.IP o 3
IR-DYN,
.IP o 3
Type 0: UO-0, R-0, R-0-CRC,
.IP o 3
Type 1: UO-1 (different from RTP profile), R-1 (different from RTP profile).
.IP o 3
Type 2: UOR-2 (different from RTP profile).
.RE
.PP
Other profiles may define other packets. Please refers to the related RFCs for
more details.

.SS Encoding schemes
.PP
The IP-only, IP/UDP, IP/ESP and IP/UDP/RTP profiles uses the following schemes
in order to efficiently compress the various header fields:
.IP Least\ Significant\ Bits\ (LSB)
Transmit only the k least significant bits of the field value. Used for header
fields that are usually subject to small changes. The decompressor computes
the uncompressed value from a reference value and the transmitted bits
according to an interpretation interval around the reference value that
depends of the field behaviour.
.IP Window-based\ Least\ Significant\ Bits\ (W-LSB)
LSB algorithm modified to achieve robustness. Indeed the LSB algorithm fails
to decode the correct value if the reference value at decompressor is not the
same as at compressor. To achieve robustness, a sliding window of the
successive reference values is maintained at compressor. The number of k
least significant bits to transmit to decompressor is then computed such that
no matter which reference value the decompressor uses (if in window) the
correct value is decoded.
.IP Scaled\ RTP\ Timestamp
A compression scheme defined for the RTP Timestamp (TS). The TS value does not
increase by an arbitrary value from packet to packet. It increases by a
multiple of some unit that depends on the audio/video sample rate and frame
duration. The compressor can therefore transmit only the multiplication factor
once the increment unit is known at the decompressor.
.IP Timer-based\ RTP\ Timestamp
A scheme that compresses RTP Timestamp (TS) further than the Scaled RTP
Timestamp. If the sampling rate of the source is constant, then the TS value
closely approximates a linear function of the time of day. So, by using a
local clock the decompressor can obtain an approximation of the scaled TS in
the header to be decompressed by considering its arrival time. Some LSB bits
of scaled TS are transmitted in the packets to refine the approximation and
handle jitter.
.IP Offset\ IP-ID
A compression scheme dedicated to IPv4 Identification field. The RTP SN
increases by one from one packet to another. If the IP-ID behaves similarly,
it is more efficient to transmit the offset between the two values instead of
the IP-ID itself.
.IP Self-describing\ variable-length\ (SDVL)
Not really a compression scheme, SDVL is a field format that transmits values
between 0 and 536,870,911 in a minimal number of bytes. Only 1 byte is used
for values up to 127, 2 bytes for values up to 16,383... The first bits of the
field are used to encode the field length, hence the scheme's name.
.IP List\ encoding
List encoding is used to transmit in an efficient way different types of
lists. They are used for CSRC lists in RTP packets and extension header chains
in IP packets.
.PP
Other profiles may define other encoding scheme. Please refers to the related
RFCs for more details.
