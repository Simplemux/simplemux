rohc \- The ROHC protocol and library

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBROHC\fP acronym stands for \fBRObust Header Compression\fP. It may
refer to two different elements:
.RS
.IP o
the \fBROHC protocol\fP,
.IP o
the \fBROHC library\fP.
.RE

.SS The ROHC protocol
.PP
The \fBROHC protocol\fP aims at \fBreducing bandwidth\fP usage on network
links with \fBlimited capacity\fP or \fBexpensive costs\fP, such as mobile
networks or satellite links. It defines a \fBlossless compression scheme\fP
for network headers. It does not act on the network payload in any way.
.PP
The \fBROHC protocol\fP is very efficient for compressing \fBVoIP streams\fP
that use \fBRTP\fP as transport protocol. \fBROHC\fP is also suitable for
compressing \fBIPv4\fP, \fBIPv6\fP, \fBUDP\fP, \fBUDP-Lite\fP, \fBESP\fP, and
\fBTCP\fP headers of Internet packets.
.PP
See
.BR rohc_protocol (7)
for more details about the ROHC protocol.

.SS The ROHC library
.PP
The \fBROHC library\fP is an implementation of the \fBROHC protocol\fP. It
provides an easy and robust way for applications to reduce their bandwidth
usage on network links with limited capacity or expensive costs. Headers of
network packets are compressed with the \fBROHC protocol and algorithms\fP.
.PP
The \fBROHC library\fP is intended for developers who want to reduce the
bandwidth requirements of their applications. The library is published under
the \fBGPL license\fP (version 2 or later).
