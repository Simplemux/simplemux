21 June 2014 - release 1.7.0
  Compatibility:
    - Version 1.7.0 is not compatible with versions < 1.7.0 with respect to
      packet format because of several fixes related to IETF RFCs that change
      the format of ROHC packets. Compatibility may however be required with
      the library feature ROHC_COMP_FEATURE_COMPAT_1_6_x.
    - The library API is fully compatible with earlier versions.

  License/Authors:
    - Viveris Technologies for the packet/context repair upon CRC failure.
    - Viveris Technologies for better conformance to ROHC standards.
    - FWX for ROHCv1 TCP profile.
    - Remove the Lulea University of Technology from the authors: code changed
      so much since fork that nothing remains from the initial code.
    - Remove fuzzer's co-author: he gave ownership and copyright to Didier
      Barvaux.
    - Add copyright information to all source files.
    - Change license from GPLv2+ to LGPLv2.1+

  Acknowledgments for bug reports and/or bug fixes:

09 Jun 2013 - release 1.6.0

      fixes related to IETF RFCs that change the format of ROHC packets.
    - The library API is mainly compatible with earlier versions: some private
      entities that were made public by mistake are not public anymore. It
      might break some programs that were using them by mistake.

  License/Authors:
    - Mikhail Gruzdev, Thales Communications, and Viveris Technologies for
      Linux kernel support.
    - Audric Schiltknecht and Julien Bernard from Viveris Technologies for

  API changes:
    - Add rohc_compress2(), rohc_comp_get_segment() and return code
      ROHC_NEED_SEGMENT to handle ROHC segments.
    - Update rohc_decompress() to return ROHC_NON_FINAL_SEGMENT to handle ROHC
      segments.

      library traces with user-defined callbacks.

      rohc_feedback_unlock() (restore feedbacks if transmission failed).
    - Add rohc_comp_get_last_packet_info2() to get compression statistics.

      rohc_comp_get_max_cid() and rohc_comp_get_cid_type() to replace
      functions rohc_c_info(), rohc_c_statistics() and rohc_c_context() that
      are now deprecated.

      contexts.

      private headers.
    - public header cleanup: move all private decompressor definitions from
      rohc_decomp.h to rohc_decomp_internals.h

  Build system:
    - Append bzr revision number to library version if built from bzr.
    - Split --enable-rohc-apps into several different options (see below).
    - Add --disable-deprecated-api to disable deprecated code (testing only).
    - Change the behavior of the --enable-rohc-debug configure option:
      Old behavior: --enable-rohc-debug={1,2,3} configured as build time the
                    level of debug of the library.
      New behavior: --enable-rohc-debug={yes,no} configures only extra debug
                    for the library.
      Debug traces are managed by the new trace framework. Extra debug traces
      that may reduce the library performances are only enabled if
      --enable-rohc-debug or --enable-rohc-debug=yes are specified. The extra
      debug traces are off by default.
    - Use CPPFLAGS for -I options instead of CFLAGS.
    - Do not override CFLAGS, CPPFLAGS, and LDFLAGS in configure.

    - Move all private definitions out from public headers.
    - Define many private functions as static in UDP and UDP-Lite profiles.

  Performances:
    - Simplify the rohc_f_32bits() function.

    - Stop search for the compression context if all used contexts were
      already checked.
    - Create all compression contexts at init instead of at runtime.
    - Dump compressed and uncompressed packets only in extra debug mode.
    - Avoid using zfree() when free() is enough.

  Applications:
    General:
      - Split --enable-rohc-apps into several different options:
        --enable-app-fuzzer   --enable-app-performance
        --enable-app-sniffer  --enable-app-tunnel
    ROHC-over-UDP tunnel:
      - Handle decompression.
      - Handle small/large CIDs and MAX_CID.
      - Add ROHC-over-Ethernet support (Raman Gupta).
      - Avoid using internal information from the library.
      - Fix the usage description.
    ROHC sniffer:
      - New tool that permits to easily test the library on a real network
        without affecting it. The program sniffs IP packets from a given
        network interface, and tests the ROHC library with them. The packets
        are compressed, then decompressed, and finally compared with the
        original IP packets.
    ROHC fuzzer:
      - New tool that checks the robustness of the ROHC decompressor with
        random ROHC packets. Contributed by Yura.
    Performances test:
      - Increase test duration for CPU frequency.

  Acknowledgments for bug reports and/or bug fixes:

      information about the last compressed packet.
    Add several new API functions for getting descriptions on packet types,
      extension types, mode and states.
    Deprecate crc_init_table(), crc_get_polynom() and crc_table_X from API
     (they are still available, but emit a warning).

    Avoid installing private ROHC headers on the system during install.
    Make 'make' less verbose to get output like Linux kernel build.
    Remove useless or deprecated checks from configure.ac.
