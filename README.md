# Simplemux

[[_TOC_]]

## Introduction

There are some situations in which multiplexing a number of small packets into a bigger one is desirable. For example, a number of small packets can be sent together between a pair of machines if they share a common network path. Thus, the traffic profile can be shifted from small to larger packets, reducing the network overhead and the number of packets per second to be managed by intermediate routers.

In other cases it is necessary to send tunneled packets or frames between different network locations.

Multiplexing can be combined with Tunneling and Header Compression for the optimization of small-packet flows. This is called TCM. Different algorithms for header compression, multiplexing and tunneling can be combined in a similar way to [RFC 4170](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4170).

Simplemux is a protocol able to encapsulate a number of packets belonging to different protocols into a single packet. It includes the "Protocol" field on each multiplexing header, thus allowing the inclusion of a number of packets belonging to different protocols on a packet of another protocol.

```

         +--------------------------------+
         |       Multiplexed Packet       |     Multiplexed protocol
         +--------------------------------+
         |      Multiplexing header       |     Multiplexing protocol (Simplemux)
         +--------------------------------+
         |       Tunneling header         |     Tunneling protocol
         +--------------------------------+
```

This is the structure of a packet including three multilplexed packets:

```
+-----------------+---------+----------------+---------+----------------+---------+----------------+
|Tunneling header |simplemux| muxed packet 1 |simplemux| muxed packet 2 |simplemux| muxed packet 3 |
+-----------------+---------+----------------+---------+----------------+---------+----------------+
```

The size of the simplemux separators is kept very low (it may be a single byte when multiplexing small packets) in order to reduce the overhead.

The savings can be significant. The next figure represents the significant bandwidth savings and packet-per-second reductions for small-packet flows (e.g. VoIP, FPS online games):

## About this repository

This repository includes a Linux user-space implementation of Simplemux, written in C. It uses Simplemux as the multiplexing protocol, and different options for the multiplexed and tunneling protocols:
- Multiplexed protocol: Ethernet, IP, RoHC ([RFC 5795](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5795)).
- Multiplexing protocol: Simplemux. It includes a _Protocol_ field.
- Tunneling protocol: IP, TCP/IP or UDP/IP.


### Folders

You will find the next folders:
- `src`. It includes the `.c` and `.h` files.
- `lua`. LUA scripts that can be added to Wireshark as plug-ins, which enable the dissection of Simplemux.
- `perl`. Perl scripts for extracting information from the log files.
- `documentation`.
- `simplemux_captures`. `.pcap` files captured with Wireshark.
- `rohc_library`. A copy of Didier Balvraux's RoHC library, version 1.7.0.


## Modes, flavors and multiplexing policies

### Tunnel modes

Simplemux has two *tunnel modes*, so it can include the next multiplexed protocols:

- **Tun mode**: it aggregates IP or RoHC ([RFC 5795](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5795)) packets. RoCH feedback messages are always sent in UDP/IP packets.
- **Tap mode**: it aggregates Ethernet frames.


### Modes

It includes the next options for the *tunneling* protocol, which correspond to four *modes*:

- **Network mode**: the multiplexed packet is sent in an **IP datagram** using Protocol Number `253` or `254` (according to [IANA](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml), these numbers can be used for experimentation and testing ). For **Blast** flavor, Protocol Number `252` is used.
- **UDP mode**: the multiplexed packet is sent in an **UDP/IP** datagram. In this case, the protocol number in the outer IP header is that of UDP (`17`) and both ends must agree on a UDP port (the implementation uses `55555` or `55557` by default).
- **TCP server mode**: the multiplexed packet is sent in a **TCP/IP** datagram. In this case, the protocol number in the outer IP header is that of TCP (`4`) and both ends must agree on a TCP port (the implementation uses `55555` or `55557` by default).
- **TCP client mode**: as it happens in TCP server mode, **TCP/IP** datagrams are sent.


RoHC feedback information (when using RoHC Bidirectional mode) is sent in UDP packets using port `55556` by default.

### Flavors

Simplemux has the next *flavors*:

- [**Normal**](/documentation/normal_flavor.md): it tries to compress the separators as much as possible. For that aim, some single-bit fields are used.
- [**Fast**](/documentation/fast_flavor.md): it sacrifices some compression on behalf or speed. In this case, all the separators are 3-byte long, and all have the same structure.
In TCP *mode*, the use of Simplemux *fast* is compulsory.
- [**Blast**](/documentation/blast_flavor.md): it sends the same packet a number of times. But it only delivers one copy to the end point (the one that arrives first). It does not multiplex a number of packets together. It does NOT work in TCP mode.


### Multiplexing policies

Different [multiplexing policies](/documentation/multiplexing_policies.md) can be employed, depending on the flavor, i.e. four different conditions can be used and combined for triggering the sending of a multiplexed packet:

- Number of packets/frames: A number of packets/frames is defined. For example, if N=3, the optimizer will send one packet every three input packets/frames.
- Size: A maximum size is defined. When it is reached, the sending is triggered.
- Timeout: A time is defined. If it has expired when a packet/frame arrives, the sending is triggered.
- Period: A period is defined. At the end of the period, all the stored packets are sent.


### Protocol stack

### Summary

Simplemux has 3 _flavors_ (_Normal_, _Fast_ and _Blast_), 2 _tunnel modes_ (_Tun_ and _Tap_), 3 _modes_ (_Network_, _UDP_ and _TCP)_, and it can be used with or without RoHC compression. Therefore, it has 3x2x3x2 (36) options, in addition to the 4 multiplexing policies. However, not all the combinations have been implemented or do make sense.

The next table details the options that are available:

|        |tap|   X   |   X   |   X   |       |                               |
+--------+---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------------------------------+
|        |tun|   X   |   X   |       |       |                               |
| Blast  +---+-------+-------+-------+-------+        Always 1 packet *      |
|        |tap|   X   |   X   |       |       |                               |
+--------+---+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------------------------------+
```

* In _blast_ flavor, the packet is sent immediately. The period defines the interval used to send copies of the packet.


## Limitations of this implementation

- In _network_ flavor, only 20-byte IP headers are supported.
