simplemux
=========

There are some situations in which multiplexing a number of small packets into a bigger one is desirable. For example, a number of small packets can be sent together between a pair of machines if they share a common network path. Thus, the traffic profile can be shifted from small to larger packets, reducing the network overhead and the number of packets per second to be managed by intermediate routers.

In other cases it is necessary to send tunneled packets or frames between different network locations.

Simplemux is a protocol able to encapsulate a number of packets belonging to different protocols into a single packet. It includes the "Protocol" field on each multiplexing header, thus allowing the inclusion of a number of packets belonging to different protocols on a packet of another protocol.

The specification of Simplemux is here: http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-saldana-tsvwg-simplemux/. It has been proposed to the Transport Area Working Group of the IETF (https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/tsvwg/documents/)

The size of the multiplexing headers is kept very low (it may be a single byte when multiplexing small packets) in order to reduce the overhead.

This repository includes a Linux user-space implementation of Simplemux, written in C. It uses Simplemux as the multiplexing protocol.

It can include the next multiplexed protocols:

- Ethernet
- IP
- ROHC (RFC 5795).

It includes the next options for the *tunneling* protocol, which correspond to four *modes*:

- **IP: Network mode**: the multiplexed packet is sent in an IP datagram using Protocol Number 253 or 254 (according to IANA, these numbers can be used for experimentation and testing ).
- **UDP/IP: UDP mode**: the multiplexed packet is sent in an UDP/IP datagram. In this case, the protocol number in the outer IP header is that of UDP (17) and both ends must agree on a UDP port (the implementation uses 55555 or 55557 by default).
- **TCP/IP: TCP server mode**: the multiplexed packet is sent in a TCP/IP datagram. In this case, the protocol number in the outer IP header is that of TCP (4) and both ends must agree on a TCP port (the implementation uses 55555 or 55557 by default).
- **TCP/IP: TCP client mode**: same as TCP server mode, but it is the TCP client.


Simplemux has the next *flavors*:

- **Normal**: it tries to compress the separators as much as possible. For that aim, some single-bit fields are used.
- **Fast**: it sacrifices some compression on behalf or speed. In this case, all the separators are 3-byte long, and all have the same structure.
In TCP *mode*, the use of Simplemux *fast* is compulsory.
- **Blast**: it sends the same packet a number of times. But it only delivers one copy to the end point (the one that arrives first). It does not multiplex a number of packets together. It does NOT work in TCP mode.


ROCH feedback messages are always sent in IP/UDP packets.
