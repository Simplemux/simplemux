Simplemux
=========

# Introduction

There are some situations in which multiplexing a number of small packets into a bigger one is desirable. For example, a number of small packets can be sent together between a pair of machines if they share a common network path. Thus, the traffic profile can be shifted from small to larger packets, reducing the network overhead and the number of packets per second to be managed by intermediate routers.

In other cases it is necessary to send tunneled packets or frames between different network locations.

Multiplexing can be combined with Tunneling and Header Compression for the optimization of small-packet flows. This is called TCM. Different algorithms for header compression, multiplexing and tunneling can be combined in a similar way to RFC 4170.

Simplemux is a protocol able to encapsulate a number of packets belonging to different protocols into a single packet. It includes the "Protocol" field on each multiplexing header, thus allowing the inclusion of a number of packets belonging to different protocols on a packet of another protocol.

```

         +--------------------------------+
         |       Multiplexed Packet       |     Multiplexed protocol
         +--------------------------------+
         |      Multiplexing header       |     Multiplexing protocol (Simplemux)
         +--------------------------------+
         |       Tunneling header         |     Tunneling protocol
         +--------------------------------+
```

This is the structure of a packet including three multilplexed packets:

```
+-----------------+---------+----------------+---------+----------------+---------+----------------+
|Tunneling header |simplemux| muxed packet 1 |simplemux| muxed packet 2 |simplemux| muxed packet 3 |
+-----------------+---------+----------------+---------+----------------+---------+----------------+
```

The size of the simplemux separators is kept very low (it may be a single byte when multiplexing small packets) in order to reduce the overhead.

# About this repository

This repository includes a Linux user-space implementation of Simplemux, written in C. It uses Simplemux as the multiplexing protocol, and different options for the multiplexed and tunneling protocols:
- Multiplexed protocol: Ethernet, IP, RoHC (RFC 5795).
- Multiplexing protocol: Simplemux.
- Tunneling protocol: IP, TCP/IP or UDP/IP,

IPv6 is not supported in this implementation.

# Modes and flavors

## Tunnel modes

Simplemux has two *tunnel modes*, so it can include the next multiplexed protocols:

- **Tun mode**: it aggregates IP or RoHC (RFC 5795) packets. RoCH feedback messages are always sent in IP/UDP packets.
- **Tap mode**: it aggregates Ethernet frames.


## Modes

It includes the next options for the *tunneling* protocol, which correspond to four *modes*:

- **Network mode**: the multiplexed packet is sent in an **IP datagram** using Protocol Number 253 or 254 (according to IANA, these numbers can be used for experimentation and testing ).
- **UDP mode**: the multiplexed packet is sent in an **UDP/IP** datagram. In this case, the protocol number in the outer IP header is that of UDP (17) and both ends must agree on a UDP port (the implementation uses 55555 or 55557 by default).
- **TCP server mode**: the multiplexed packet is sent in a **TCP/IP** datagram. In this case, the protocol number in the outer IP header is that of TCP (4) and both ends must agree on a TCP port (the implementation uses 55555 or 55557 by default).
- **TCP client mode**: as it happens in TCP server mode, **TCP/IP** datagrams are sent.


## Flavors

Simplemux has the next *flavors*:

- **Normal**: it tries to compress the separators as much as possible. For that aim, some single-bit fields are used.
- [**Fast**](https://gitlab.com/josemariasaldana/simplemux/-/blob/tun_to_net_separation/documentation/fast_flavor.md): it sacrifices some compression on behalf or speed. In this case, all the separators are 3-byte long, and all have the same structure.
In TCP *mode*, the use of Simplemux *fast* is compulsory.
- [**Blast**](https://gitlab.com/josemariasaldana/simplemux/-/blob/tun_to_net_separation/documentation/blast_flavor.md): it sends the same packet a number of times. But it only delivers one copy to the end point (the one that arrives first). It does not multiplex a number of packets together. It does NOT work in TCP mode.


The initial specification of Simplemux can be found here: http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-saldana-tsvwg-simplemux/. It was never adopted by the IETF, although some discussion take place. Note: It only specifies the *Normal* flavor.
