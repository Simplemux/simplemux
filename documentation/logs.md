# Simplemux logs

Using the options `â€“l [log file name]` or `-L`, you can obtain a text file with traces. This is the format of these traces:

- timestamp: it is in microseconds. It is obtained with the function GetTimeStamp().
- event and type:
- rec: a packet has been received:
- native: a native packet has arrived to the ingress optimizer.
- muxed: a multiplexed packet has arrived to the egress optimizer.
- ROHC_feedback: a ROHC feedback-only packet has been received from the decompressor. It only contains ROHC feedback information, so there is nothing to decompress
- sent: a packet has been sent
- muxed: the ingress optimizer has sent a multiplexed packet.
- demuxed: the egress optimizer has demuxed a native packet and sent it to its destination.
- forward: when a packet arrives to the egress with a port different to the one where the optimization is being deployed, it is just forwarded to the network.
- error:
- bad_separator: the Simplemux header before the packet is not well constructed.
- demux_bad_length: the length of the packet expressed in the Simplemux header is excessive (the multiplexed packet would finish after the end of the global packet).
- decomp_failed: ROHC decompression failed.
- comp_failed: ROHC compression failed.
- drop:
- no_ROHC_mode: a ROHC packet has been received, but the decompressor is not in ROHC mode.
- size: it expresses (in bytes) the size of the packet. If it is a muxed one, it is the global size of the packet (including IP header). If it is a native or demuxed one, it is the size of the original (native) packet.
- sequence number: it is a sequence number generated internally by the program. Two different sequences are generated: one for received packets and other one for sent packets.
- IP: it is the IP address of the peer Simplemux optimizer.
- port: it is the destination port of the packet.
- number of packets: it is the number of packets included in a multiplexed bundle.
- triggering event(s): it is the cause (more than one may appear) of the triggering of the multiplexed bundle:
- numpacket_limit: the limit of the number of packets has been reached.
- size_limit: the maximum size has been reached.
- timeout: a packet has arrived once the timeout had expired.
- period: the period has expired.
- MTU: the MTU has been reached.
